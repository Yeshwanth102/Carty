# Carty


This is a simple React Native shopping cart application that displays a list of products fetched from a JSON API. Users can add items to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button displayed next to each product. The cart icon in the top right corner displays the current number of items in the cart. 

Clicking on the cart icon navigates the user to the checkout screen where they can see the list of items in their cart, their total quantity, and total price. Users can also remove items from their cart in the checkout screen. 

This application demonstrates the use of React hooks such as useState and useEffect, as well as the FlatList component for rendering a list of items. It also uses the Ionicons component from the Expo vector icons library for displaying the cart icon.
